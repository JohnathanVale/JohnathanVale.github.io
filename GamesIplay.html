<p> Hello, my name is Johnathan Valencia. Games I recommend are Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom, Red Dead Redemption, and Xenoblade Chronicles. <br /> Click the images below to be taken to the switch eshop to buy the game of your choosing. Might take a bit to load though. Nintendo website has a bit to load in. <br/><br>
I recommend red dead if you are interested in the western setting. You plays as a former outlaw forced to hunt down his former gang members as civilization reaches the dying old west. It is the <strong>Perfect</strong> cowboy game. I also love the soundtrack for this game.  <br/><br>
If you like exploring the Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom are <strong>Perfect</strong> for that. There are a huge amount of secrets to find and unique abilties to use to explore a old kingdom with a great evil at its center. The soundtrack for this is more minimal but that lets you here the wild of the game.  <br/><br>
Xenoblade is a jrpg series with real time combat that has you explore amazing environments and experience an epic story. The story of definitive involves humans living on the organic giant bionis at war with the machines living on the mechanical giant mechonis seen on the image. The combat can be overwhelming at first but the <strong>excellent</strong> music will keep hooked. The full trilogy is also only available on Nintendo Switch.  <br/><br>
I genuinely love all three games and I think everyone should just try them out once in their life.
